# Aurie Framework but Cursed
Native x86 and x64 modding framework supporting Windows ~~8.1~~ 10 x86_32 → Windows ~~11~~ 10 x86_~~64~~ 32. (and Fedora 43 w/ KDE Plasma, but only on Proton Experimental)

Aurie Framework but Cursed allows the following:
- Runtime module ~~loading~~ (WIP) / unloading (by force)
- Some extra constant/static init to make one single extra type to be staticaly init.
- Module operability (rarely)
- Hooks using ~~SafetyHook~~ Arkitekt, so good luck compiling.
- ~~Automatic~~ No memory management
- Creates new threads no one asked for.
- Dynasm hook and function generation: attempting to compile GML all the way to machine code at runtime.
  - and maybe C# too idk

## Getting help
- If you cloned this repo, it's still not too late. You can just go use the regular one still. You should do that.
